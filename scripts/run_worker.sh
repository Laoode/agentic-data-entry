# Extraction worker entrypoint.
#
# Each worker process pulls extract_page_task off Redis and calls vLLM (or the
# mock OCR fixture in dev). Default concurrency is 8: vLLM gates real
# parallelism via continuous batching, so worker processes are network-bound
# and we get more throughput from many in-flight asyncio tasks per process
# than from many processes. Tune --workers + --concurrency to match GPU
# capacity (see docs/PRD.md sizing notes).
